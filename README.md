# The-Stealth-Perimeter

A toolkit designed for the Stealth genre to put more pressure onto the player. When the player makes a mistake and is spotted, they will attempt to hide. When the AI loses the player, the Stealth Perimeter will come into play by creating an expanding area that simulates where the player could have gone -- establishing an area around the player the AI can use to investigate. While the system quickly escalates the difficulty, it is up to the developer to ensure that the game remains fun. This is simply a tool that can be used to punish mistakes by making it more difficult to escape from pursuers.
